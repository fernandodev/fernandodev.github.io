##  ä·ƒ Fernando MartÃ­nez

*Bachelor computer science, working since 2010 with mobile development (Android/iOS) and web development with Ruby on Rails. From 2016 focusing on iOS development till nowadays. The truth: always learning something else.*

It all started with game development. I've had some games published here and there, not available anymore, though good memories of when I used to program in C#, Lua script and a lot of C/C++.

Then, I've become fullstack developer. I've fell in love with Ruby. - I am yet to find such lovely language to program. I've got to love doing APIs in Ruby on Rails for my Android and iOS apps.

Nowadays, mostly iOS/Swift. Though, always snooping something. - I find it really interesting that once you become programmer you want to build things all the time. Or would it be that you become a programmer because you love to build things? ðŸ¤”

Several years ago I've taken down this domain, but now here I am starting a new blog.
I plan to talk about any kind of programming things, mostly problems I face day to day. Actually, I only intend to talk about problems faced vs solution taken, and honestly, might be a disappointing solution ðŸ˜‚
